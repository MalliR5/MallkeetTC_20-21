 Mallikeet timecode projects from 2020 to 2021

This is a collection of 2 of my Timecode showfiles in MagicQ, as well as their corresponding Capture visualization files. 
The corresponding music files or XHW's are NOT included for obvious reasons. You'll need to get the music files yourself (preferrably legally), and provide them to their cue stack in MagicQ. 
I've included the duration of each file, so you know which version of the song to get. 

The ones included are:

Auditorium.shw
Some oversized, massive auditorium I threw together without using any references to have a little playground to play with different fixture types.

Contains a timecode of: 

Ruin by Ekali & 1788-L (03:55)
(My very first timecode)
To play this one, hit Playback 1, and it will activate the other 3 playbacks too. They play in parallel, however there isn't an easy way to pause all of them at the same time.
Be warned, this particular rig is an absolute GPU thrasher. I don't recommend trying to run it at 1080p unless you have at least a GTX 1080 Ti or a RTX 3060 Ti equivalent.

AC2019.shw
This is an attempted remake of the Anthrocon 2019 main stage rig, designed by Robert Andrews (www.3vector.com).
It's not accurate to the actual rig at all since when I made it I didn't have plots, so instead I went kinda crazy with it. But it captures the general idea at least.
It's a rig I'm very fond of since it was a 100% color mixed rig. 

Contains timecodes of: 

Wake Up The President by Carpenter Brut (4:16)
My third timecode project, made sometime around October 2020. Probably the one I'm least proud of though. Located on Playback 1

Children (Dany BPM Hardstyle Remix) by Robert Miles & DanyBPM.  https://soundcloud.com/danybpm/robert-miles-children-dany-bpm-hardstyle-remix
My fourth timecode project, and my most intricate. Very proud of this one. Made around December 2020. Located on Playback 2.

Orange Heart by Headhunterz (3:50).
A crack at a much simpler project with a stronger focus on powerful and reusable looks and positions, rather than intricacy. Really tried to play in to the Dragon theming as best I could.
Very proud of this one too. Located on Playback 3.

Timeless (Radio Edit) by Wildstylez (4:16)
An abandoned work-in-progress that didn't get past the first couple of looks before I ran out of motivation. I started it with the idea that it could be like the opening song for a fully timecoded set.
Maybe I'll finish it, eventually.

Both of these timecodes run internally within MagicQ, so no hardware is needed to run them. 
Additionally, playing with and running the visualization does not require a Capture license, and even the demo version can open and connect with MagicQ. You just can't save any changes unless you have the proper license.

Do what you want with these, just please don't claim them as your own (after all, I'm trying to start a career here). 
Hopefully you find them helpful and inspiring. If you do find them helpful, please do consider dropping me a line, @Mallikeet on Twitter and Telegram, Mallikeet#7843 on Discord. I'd love to see what you create as well!

Light be with you.
